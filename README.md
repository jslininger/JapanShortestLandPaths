# JapanShortestLandPaths
A project for a Japanese history class that allows the user to explore the length of time it would take the average 
person to travel across the island throughout several periods of history.

Made with few dependencies so any system with python installed should be able to run it. Optional pyinstaller compiled library is included, only tested 
on Windows 10 and Linux via WINE.
