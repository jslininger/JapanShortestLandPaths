Directions: Select the period you wish to test by clicking the "Period" button on the left. This will bring up a drop-down menu where you can
select one of 3 periods. Starts in Tokugawa by default. A checkmark will be next to the current selected period. Select another period and the
railway map will change. To find the time it will take to get from one location to another, select locations from the "Start Town" and 
"End Town" buttons in the same manner as before. These locations change based on the period, although some will be in multiple periods.
After two towns are selected, press the "Find fastest time" button to calculate the estimated time of travel in that period.

It is recommended to use the default window size. Scaling the window is possible but the buttons and images do scale, making them harder
to see in a larger window.

Times are under estimates based on averages without taking into account human needs or variances. Thus every time will be lower than it 
would be in the real-world. These estimates are not meant for complete accuracy but are meant to depict the differences in time between
multiple periods of Japan's locomotive history from before, early on, and modern. 

This  version of the application only written and tested on Windows, although it should theoretically work on other systems.
